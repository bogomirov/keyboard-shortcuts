#Introduction

As a software, internet or digital media professional, your time is of essence. You need to be quick and precise in accomplishing your tasks. That is why in your daily operations you heavily rely on your keyboard.

The software packages and environments you use nowadays are huge. Together with their extensions they provide you with multiple ways to accomplish almost anything in their field.

**The only problem is if you could remember how.**

When under pressure, gunning for that deadline, you have no time to dwell into manuals, learn new features, let search for keyboard shortcuts. You just blindly run, relying on what you know by heart. But human memory is a tricky thing - it doesn't always play by the rules you may expect. So when you are under pressure, you stick to the basics, start making errors, and as a result you under-perform.

**The images provided here intend to get you back in track, today.**

Your desktop background is always in your field of vision, regardless whether you work, relax with your favorite game or your attention is away. As a plain image however, it serves a little purpose. What if you could utilize that huge empty area on your desktop better?

The images provided here have been prepared with the intention to serve multiple purposes and balance on multiple criteria:

* They are with reduced contrast, so you do not get distracted from your task.

* They are desaturated. In this way the applications you use, with their aggressive colors and widgets practically stand out, and you can immediately distinguish them from the background.

* Layout that efficiently uses the space of your multi-monitor setup, separating application and desktop environment keyboard shortcuts, icons and desktop widgets.

* The keyboard shortcuts, while being sharp and distinguishable on the one hand, do not distract you unnecessarily from your task, while on the other do not compromise the image in the back. They unobtrusively "fly" in the middle, so you can focus back and forth between applications, shortcuts and background in a split-second.

* Emphasize on tasks and less on details. Contrary to most user manuals, the emphasis here is on tasks and not keyboard shortcuts. In this way you just need to locate in the hierarchical tree the task you seek to accomplish and not explicitly memorize keyboard shortcuts.

* Implicitly learn on the go. Due to the hierarchical organization of the content, while visually scrolling on the tree seeking the task you need, you implicitly realize how to accomplish many other similar tasks.

* Coherent design. It is practically impossible to fit all shortcuts of all applications on a single desktop background. If you place the shortcuts for the different applications on separate images, you could switch to the desktop background relevant to the application you use at the moment.

* Provide a calm environment. It is a common truth that when you are calm, you make less errors and perform better. That is why the images provided here have been chosen such that have relaxing effect.

* Quick access. Your desktop background is in your field of vision all the time. To find any detail you need, you just minimize the application you are using, which is a click away.

In short, instead being just a plain image of dubious value, your professional desktop background can provide you with the speed, accuracy and cognitive offload you need in order to perform better.

To create desktop backgrounds encompassing all display resolutions, multi-monitor layouts, application shortcuts and personal tastes is practically impossible. Neither this project has such an ambition. For the time being, the images provided here:

* Support horizontal, linear dual 1080p (3840x1080 px) monitor set-up

* Contain keyboard shortcuts for the following applications and environments:

  * [Adebe After Effects](backgrounds/after-effects.png)

  * [Adobe Illustrator](backgrounds/illustrator.png)

  * [Adobe Photoshop](backgrounds/photoshop.png)

  * [Blender](backgrounds/blender.png)

  * [Eclipse IDE with PHP Development Tools](backgrounds/eclipse-pdt.png)

  * [Microsoft OneNote](backgrounds/onenote.png)

  * [Microsoft Windows Active Desktop](backgrounds/active-desktop.png)
